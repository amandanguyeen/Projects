# Projects
Personal Projects I have worked on along with my Computing Science courses

Some of the notable projects here:
1) The minesweeper game in Arduino MEGA 2560. This was a game where me and my partner David Herczeg worked at making our own version of the minesweeper game. It is inside the C++ and Arduino folder.
2) 2048 in python.
3) The app I made for my personal assignment called RideBook.
Enjoy!
